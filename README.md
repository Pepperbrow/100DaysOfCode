# 100DaysOfCode
This repository will contain my daily exercises and proof of challenge progress.
The files are, in the main, not complete pieces of work, but rather experimentation and proof of understanding and application of principles.
Feel free to comment if you see something and think "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T DO THAT!".
